# Social Coding
Welcome to Giveth's Social Coding Circle.

Our philosophy: the best way to develop tools for building a [DAC](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/governance/) is to build a community of altruistic developers. So how does one build a community of altruistic developers ?

Well the way we see it is to give them a space where they can play, where they can try to build whatever they want and over time the tools should sort themselves out. At its most basic level the responsibility of Social Coding is to oversee anything beyond basic DApp development. Think of it as a zesty combination of R&D, coding bootcamp with a hint of community outreach.

The general cycle looks like this:

* Each month the Giveth team has a brainstorming session. (Join our next one) During these sessions everybody discusses what they want to work on.

* Projects that get a lot of interest are greenlit, some projects continue to be developed within social_coding, others don’t.

* Our goal (ideally) is for projects with a minimum of two people interested to move forward . Obviously this will not always be the case —  people will pursue what they feel impelled to.

# Active Projects

## Points Bot
A platform agnostic ERC20 bot where users or DAO entities can tip each other in tokens. The plan is to begin with Slack, Riot, and Twitter integrations, and then growing beyond.

## Xchange Rates

A tool that gives any exchange rate provided by cryptocompare API at any given day. It is aimed at people willing to justify a payment as you can get a link that will load the specific pair and date and value that you selected. The functionality and appearance needs improvement. Speacially, it should support a way to share rates of the current date in a stable fashion, as right now by taking the daily average, "today's rate" keeps changing throughout the day.
